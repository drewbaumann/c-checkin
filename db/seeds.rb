# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#   
#   cities = City.create([{ :name => 'Chicago' }, { :name => 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Major.create(:name => 'Daley', :city => cities.first)
# ['Drop-in & Community Membership',
#   'Part-time Membership',
#   'Full-time Membership',
#   'Nights & Weekends Membership'].each do |name|
#     
#     Plan.create :name => name
#     puts "Creating #{name}"
# end
